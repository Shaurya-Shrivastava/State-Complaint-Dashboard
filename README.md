# 🧠 State Complaints Dashboard (In Progress)

This repository hosts my **State Complaints Dashboard Project**, where I’ll be performing data analysis and building a fully interactive dashboard to understand complaint patterns across all Indian states.

---

## 📌 Current Status: as of 2 Nov 2025  
- ✅ Static dataset created using Build.Dataset AI, covering 3 years and 36 states/UTs.

- ✅ Performed Initial EDA in Python using Pandas and Matplotlib:
  - Total complaints per state
  - Most common complaint categories
  - Resolution rate by state
  - Complaint trends over time (year-wise)

- 📊 Visual insights generated in matplotlib and saved for future dashboard use

**Next steps:** 
- 🔜 Build data model and start designing Power BI dashboard  
- 🔜 Document SQL queries and dashboard insights  
- 🔜 Add project roadmap and future scope in this README
