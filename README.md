# 🧠 State Complaints Dashboard (In Progress)

This repository hosts my **State Complaints Dashboard Project**, where I’ll be performing data analysis and building a fully interactive dashboard to understand complaint patterns across all Indian states.

---

## 📌 Current Status: 🚧 Project Kickoff  
- ✅ Project initialized on GitHub  
- ✅ Static dataset prepared using AI-based data generation (`build.dataset`)  
- ✅ Dataset includes details of complaints (2023–2025), customers, states, and categories  
- 📂 Data available under `/data` folder in `.csv` format  

**Next steps:**
- 🔜 Load data into SQL database and perform EDA using SQL  
- 🔜 Build data model and start designing Power BI dashboard  
- 🔜 Document SQL queries and dashboard insights  
- 🔜 Add project roadmap and future scope in this README
